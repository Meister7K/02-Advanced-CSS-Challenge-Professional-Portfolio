## Description

- This website was built to display a portfolio of my work via links to my previous and current web development projects. The website is meant to be responsive and user friendly. This project gave me a location to showcase my work and share it with others. I learned core tools of CSS and HTML along with specifics of flexbox, class selectors, links, and element sizing.
